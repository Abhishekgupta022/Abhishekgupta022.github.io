            <p style="font-size: 130%;color: blue;">Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.<br/> <strong>Many students define paragraphs </strong>in terms of <em>length</em>: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>
